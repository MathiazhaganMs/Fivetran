Test Automation Documentation for Fivetran Local Data Processing
Introduction
This document outlines the test automation strategy and approach for Fivetran Local Data Processing. The purpose is to ensure the reliability and functionality of the Local Processing Hub System, including its components such as the Local Processing Hub Server, Repository Database, Jobs, Scheduler, Log Files, Router Files, and High-Volume Agent (HVA).
Test Objectives
		Validate Installation and Compatibility:
	•	Ensure Fivetran Local Data Processing can be installed on supported operating systems (Linux and Windows).
	•	Verify compatibility with different environments (physical, virtual, or containerized).
		Functional Testing:
	•	Confirm that the Local Processing Hub System performs the core functionalities, including capturing changes, refreshing data, integrating changes, and comparing data.
		Integration Testing:
	•	Validate the integration of data between source and target locations through the Local Processing Hub System.
		User Interface (UI) Testing:
	•	Validate the functionality and responsiveness of the Local Data Processing web UI.
	•	Confirm that users can configure and operate Local Data Processing effectively through the UI.
		REST API Testing:
	•	Confirm the functionality and reliability of the REST APIs for users who want to script interactions or integrate Local Data Processing into their applications.
Test Environment
Supported Operating Systems:
	•	Linux
	•	Windows
Database:
	•	PostgreSQL (for the repository database)
Test Automation Framework
Framework Choice: Pytest
Reasoning:
	•	Pytest is a popular testing framework for Python with good support for test automation.
	•	It provides concise syntax and powerful features for test parametrization and fixtures.
Test Scenarios
1. Installation and Compatibility
	•	Scenario 1: Verify successful installation on Linux machines.
	•	Scenario 2: Verify successful installation on Windows machines.
	•	Scenario 3: Test compatibility with different environments (physical, virtual, containerized).

2. Functional Testing
	•	Scenario 1: Validate the core functionalities of the Local Processing Hub System.
	•	Scenario 2: Test capturing changes in real-time from source locations.
	•	Scenario 3: Verify data compression and optional encryption.
	•	Scenario 4: Test data integration into target locations.

3. Integration Testing
	•	Scenario 1: Validate end-to-end data integration between source and target locations.
	•	Scenario 2: Verify proper routing of data within the Local Processing Hub System.

5. User Interface (UI) Testing
	•	Scenario 5.1: Verify the functionality of the web UI in configuring Local Data Processing.
	•	Scenario 5.2: Test the responsiveness of the web UI on different devices.

7. REST API Testing
	•	Scenario 7.1: Confirm the functionality and reliability of REST APIs.
	•	Scenario 7.2: Test scriptability and integration capabilities.

Test Data Generation
Generate test data that covers various scenarios and edge cases for different types of transactions, changes, and integrations.
Test Execution Strategy
		Sequential Execution:
	•	Execute test scenarios sequentially for better traceability.
		Parallel Execution:
	•	Implement parallel test execution for faster feedback.
		Environment Isolation:
	•	Ensure each test scenario has an isolated environment to prevent interference.
		Continuous Integration (CI):
	•	Integrate test automation into the CI pipeline for automated regression testing.
Test Reporting
	•	Detailed test reports will be generated after each test run.
	•	Include information on test status, execution time, and any failures.

Test Maintenance
	•	Regularly review and update automated tests to align with changes in Fivetran Local Data Processing.
	•	Keep test scripts under version control to track changes.

Risks and Mitigations
		Dependency Changes:
	•	Risk: Changes in dependencies may break test automation.
	•	Mitigation: Regularly update dependencies and run tests in the development environment.
		Environment Stability:
	•	Risk: Instability in the testing environment.
	•	Mitigation: Implement environment setup and teardown scripts to ensure consistency.
		Data Consistency:
	•	Risk: Inconsistencies in test data may affect test results.
	•	Mitigation: Implement data setup scripts and version-controlled test data.
